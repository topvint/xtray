title: Xtray for the Original Xbox

Installation instructions

Please follow these simple instructions:

Open up your Xbox using a T20 TORX screw driver. There are 4 screws under the rubber feet, and two additional screws under the stickers.
With the console in the upright positions, remove the top part of the shell by just pulling upwards
With a T9 TORX screw driver, uncrew the screw joining up the HDD and DVD trays, as well as the two screws holding the DVD drive tray to the front part of the console
Unplug the grey IDE flat cable and yellow power cable from the DVD drive. Unplug the yellow power cable also from the motherboard.
Unplug the power Molex cable from the HDD drive and unthread it from the HDD tray so that you can lift up the HDD tray
Once the HDD tray is partially lifted, you will have enough room to lift the DVD drive tray. Remove the DVD drive from the console
Re-sit back the HDD tray to the original position, threading back the power cable on the side, and pluging back the Molex power cable into the HDD
Remove the DVD drive face plate by pulling gently from the bottom of the faceplate while pushing upwards. If its more confortable, you can use a tool to help you. The faceplate is secured in place by a couple of plastic clips which hold it in the tray. It will be obvious once you take a look.
In order to insert the faceplate in the Xtray bracket, unscrew the Xtray PCB to ensure there is as much slack as possible of the LED strip. Move the strip to one side and carefully slide the faceplate from the top until it clips in place. Then loop the LED strip around the inserted faceplate. The kit is designed to keep the LED strip tight around the faceplate while giving just the right amount of slack to loop it while the Xtray PCB is unscrewed. Therefore is a tight fit but it is not difficult. However please be careful as the LED strip is delicate.
Make sure the LED strip is tight around the faceplate so that the Xtray PCB can sit in the right palce in order to be screwed back
Screw the Xtray bracket in place of where the DVD drive used to sit before you removed it, using the same screws to secure it in place
Connect the provided power cable to both the Xtray PCB and the DVD drive power connector in the Xbox motherboard.
Turn on the console and adjust the brightness of the LED by inserting a flat screw driver in the potentiometer installed in the Xtray PCB. The circuit is designed not to exceed the maximum power that the LED strip can handle (100mA) no matter how much you turn it.
When you are happy with the britghness level, put back the top of shell and screw it back in place.
Turn off the lights during gameplay and enjoy your OG Xbox!
